Compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance but requiring platform-specific executables.

This ensures that resources are consistently deallocated and prevents potential issues like memory leaks, making programs more robust and stable.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans - Using multithreading in certain applications is important for improving performance, responsiveness, and efficiency, especially in tasks that involve I/O-bound operations or concurrent workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Improves Responsiveness (UI/GUI Apps)\n",
        "\n",
        "In applications with user interfaces (like desktop apps), multithreading helps keep the UI responsive while background tasks (e.g. file downloads) run in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Example: While a user is typing, a background thread can load data without freezing the interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Efficient I/O-bound Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "For tasks like reading files, making API calls, or querying databases, multithreading allows other threads to run while one waits, using less CPU idle time.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Example: A web scraper downloading from multiple websites at once using threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Handles Concurrent Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading allows multiple tasks to happen at the same time, making your application more efficient in handling simultaneous activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Example: A server handling multiple client requests at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Better Resource Utilization\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads share memory space, making them lightweight and less resource-intensive than full processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Useful in Real-Time Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications like chat apps, games, or sensor-monitoring systems use threads to manage continuous data streams alongside other logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations to Keep in Mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "In CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. So multithreading isn’t ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CPU-heavy tasks, use multiprocessing instead.\n",
